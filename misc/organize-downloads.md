You're not alone — the **Downloads folder** is where digital clutter goes to party 😅. But since you’re already thinking about this, let’s get it under control with a system that works for **your workflow** (tech projects, documents, references, and cat-related randomness).

## 🧼 Step-by-Step Cleanup Plan (One-Time and Ongoing)

### 1. **Sort by File Type**

Start with a quick triage:

* In File Explorer (Windows): click **Group by → Type**
* Or search by extensions:

  * `*.docx`, `*.pdf`, `*.zip`, `*.jpg`, `*.3mf`, `*.stl`, etc.

Now you can mass-select and move similar files at once.

---

### 2. **Make These Core Subfolders**

In your Downloads folder (or right above it), create:

```
Downloads/
├── 📥  _Inbox_Triage/         ← where all new stuff lands
├── 📄  Docs_Ref/
├── 🧰  Installers_Tools/
├── 🧪  Tests_TempTrash/
├── 📷  Images/
├── 🧾  Receipts_Orders/
├── 🧠  AI_Generated/
├── 📦  Zips_Extracted/
```

Then add folders specific to your work:

```
├── 🔧  3D_Prints_STLs/
├── 🏠  HA_YAML/
├── 🚗  AutoTech_Notes/
```

You can script or manually sweep files into these.

### 3. **Automation (Optional but Powerful)**

If you're on Windows:

* Use **Power Automate Desktop** (free from Microsoft) to auto-move:

  * `.stl` or `.3mf` → `3D_Prints_STLs`
  * `.docx`, `.pdf` → `Docs_Ref`
  * `.zip` → `Zips_Extracted`

If you're on macOS:

* Use **Hazel** (3rd party app) or Finder Smart Folders to do similar file moves.

If you want, I’ll build you a small PowerShell or AppleScript that can sort files by extension and last modified date.

---

### 4. **Create a Habit**

When you download a file:

* **Don’t leave it in Downloads** — either file it or delete it.
* Open `Downloads/Inbox_Triage/` once a week and clean it out like email.

---

### 5. **Bonus — Dashy Block for Quick Access**

If you're using Dashy:

* Create a block with links to your organized folders (`STLs`, `HA_YAML`, `Docs_Ref`, etc.)
* Add a “⚠️ Inbox Triage” card that turns red if it has 20+ files using a small script (optional).

---

Want me to:

* Build a cleanup script for your Downloads folder?
* Generate a batch file to move old files into subfolders by type/date?
* Help you zip/archive everything older than 60 days?

This is a quick project we can automate in one go if you’re ready.
