# Tony's Technical Tutorials

Welcome to my personal documentation and reference vault.  
This repo stores my:
- 3D printer tuning notes (Sovol SV08, Klipper, Bambu, Voron)
- Home Assistant configuration guides and workflow tricks
- Proxmox / virtualization setup notes
- NAS, VLAN, networking, and self-hosting knowledge
- Random tech fixes I don't want to forget later

## Why this repo exists
I learn by doing — and by breaking — and by fixing.  
This repo keeps the fixes, so I *don’t* have to remember everything.
